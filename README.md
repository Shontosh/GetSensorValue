# GetSensorValue
I learn couple of things during this app building. Previoulsy i have no idea about sensormanegr. Now i can work with this.
I have learned how to use multiple table in a sngle SQLite Database. I have idea about  foreground service and notification 
but previously didn't worked with updating values in notification . Now i can update values in foreground notification.

I have completed first 3 task. Task number 4 was making the app look pretty good and i tried to make it better by adding animation when intent 
are changing.
